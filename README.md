# Veterinaria TuCan
It is a web app in React, as a first approach to the framework. Where its main objective was to build a CRUD to store the data of the patients of a veterinary. The model must have the following properties:

Pet name
Type of pet (dog, cat, parrot, ETC)
Breed of the pet
Date of birth of the pet
Owner's first and last name
Owner's phone number
Owner's address
Owner's email address

The data persistence was created in Firebase.

Note: the name and logo of the veterinarian was selected from the internet for example uses.
